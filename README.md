# jsdoc-extractor

## Development

- `yarn -s dev:test` gives fast feedback with many simple unit tests.

- https://ts-ast-viewer.com can be extremely help when trying to get a birds eye view of the AST. Sometimes you see data that you wish you were shown the API navigation calls to get it. But even without that it is still very handy to at least get a sense.

- Amazing use-case for [Quokka.js](https://quokkajs.com/) if you have it. Set yourself up a test module using techniques like those seen in `test/setup.ts` and get the best possible feedback loop going!

- Very little information about the TS AST seems available. There is [the Wiki](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/Using-the-Compiler-API) and a bit of information here https://sandersn.github.io/manual/Typescript-compiler-implementation.html.
